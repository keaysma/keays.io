# What the heck is this?

I redid [keays.io](https://keays.io) using SvelteKit!

## Running
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
