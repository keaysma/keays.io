# What the heck is this?

I redid [keays.io](https://keays.io) using SvelteKit!

Now featuring SvelteKit 5 + Deno!

## Running

```bash
deno i
deno run dev
```

## Building

```bash
deno run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `deno run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
