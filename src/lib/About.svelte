            Passionate technologist, enthusiastic learner, strong communicator,
            and experienced leader. Excited to take on new opportunities and
            challanges. I have spent time building skills across several
            different software industries since I was young. I am at my best
            when trailblazing, and enjoy working as both a self-starter, a team
            member, and also as a mentor. While I focus myself as a developer, I
            love working with all parts of the software cycle: From management,
            to quality, to marketing, user experience, and all parts in between.
