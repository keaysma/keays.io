The idea was to create an similarly useful tool for linguistic students to quickly prototype and validate syntax trees. I typically only work on this tool for maybe 1-2 weeks out of the year, making improvements based on different things I have learned. The original prototype was written in a Jupyter Notebook, which I later converted into a Flask server hosted on Heroku (RIP, have not put it back up yet). As part of the web-based transition, I worked on performance optimizations that brought the average compute time for a sentence down from 30 seconds to about 1/1000 of a second. Currently I'm preparing to put it back online as a pair of domain-driven services written in Rust and Python, with a frontend in ... I haven't decided yet!",
